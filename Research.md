#Research Plan for KK's Pet Sitting App

1. Title:   KK's Pet Sitting App Field Study
2. Authors and Stakeholders:  Andrea Kim (myself), Brian Behnke, clients
3. Date: due Thursday 8/18/16
4. Background: This study is for a pet sitting client app for KKâ€™s Pet Sitting, a company I own.  I have stopped this company in order to become an Android Developer, but it is a good use case for an app, and I can make apps referencing this base app for other pet care services in the future.
5. Goals: The main reason for the study is to guage whether it would be useful for clients to utilize the app and which would be the most useful features.
6. Research Questions:
  Is an app necessary for a pet care business?
  How likely are users to actually utilize the app?
  How often?
  What features would be mandatory?
  What features would be nice to have, but not necessary?
  Which features would be a bad idea/what users would NOT like to see?
7. Methodology: I will start by creating a survey out to clients and general public via social media and email.  I will look at results and determine how many people to interview personally for more information. I will then interview them and see what can be gleaned from those interactions. Once a prototype app or wireframe is laid out, I will begin user testing and continue that throughout cycle until the MVP is delivered.
8. Participants: My target audience is users of pet care services. I have a large client base from which to get information.
9. Schedule: Participant recruiting will start 8/8/16, the study will take place during the week of 8/8-13/16. 
The results should be ready by Sunday, 8/14/16.
